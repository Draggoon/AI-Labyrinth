# AI-Labyrinth
A test to experiment on DirectX and Universal Windows Platform.

The first cursor is controlled by the player (arrow keys).
All other cursors are controlled by an AI
key + adds a cursor
key - removes the last added cursor
key * augments framerate
key / reduces framerate
esc quits

Current AI walks randomly.
